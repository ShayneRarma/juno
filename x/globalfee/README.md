# GlobalFee

Sets a global required minimum fee for all Transactions via Governance.

This Global fee module was supplied by [Gaia](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia/tree/main/x/globalfee) which was from [TGrade](https://github.com/confio/tgrade).

## Juno's Addition

Allow a Governance gated group of accounts access to temporarily change the fees for a set period in case of an attack (as the proposal would take far too long).
